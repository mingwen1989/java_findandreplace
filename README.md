# Java Find And Replace

#### By _Ming Wen_

## Description

A website where a user enters a string, chooses a word in that string and provides a replacement for that word. The method in action looks something like myGame.findAndReplace("hello world", "world", "universe"), the result of which would be "Hello universe".

Method takes into account matches that are not whole words. For example myGame.findAndReplace("I am walking my cat to the cathedral", "cat", "dog") would return the silly phrase "I am walking my dog to the doghedral."
